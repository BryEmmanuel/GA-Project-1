# GA-Project-1: Snake Game

Based on the concept of the original snake game

## Description of the game

Snake is about an ever-growing snake that grows in length whenever it eats. The speed of the snake increases as more food is eaten. The goal is to eat as much food as possible, avoiding collision with the game border or itself.
